# EcoRoute: AI-Powered Sustainable Route Planning Application

## Abstract

EcoRoute is an innovative web-based route planning application that integrates environmental consciousness with intelligent navigation technology. The application combines OpenStreetMap's comprehensive mapping data with advanced AI capabilities to provide users with detailed route information while calculating the environmental impact of their travel choices.

The system features real-time route calculation using the Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) API, delivering accurate turn-by-turn directions along actual road networks. A sophisticated carbon footprint calculator analyzes eight different vehicle types—including petrol, diesel, electric, hybrid cars, motorcycles, buses, trains, and flights—providing users with precise CO₂ emissions data, fuel consumption estimates, and tree offset requirements based on their chosen mode of transportation and vehicle efficiency.

EcoRoute leverages OpenRouter's AI technology to deliver contextual destination information, travel recommendations, and interactive assistance through a dedicated chat interface. The application employs a secure backend architecture using PHP to protect API credentials while maintaining responsive performance.

Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA), EcoRoute offers cross-platform compatibility with native-like functionality on both desktop and mobile devices, including offline capabilities and home screen installation on Android. The responsive design features a Google Maps-inspired interface with an intuitive bottom-sheet layout for mobile users, collapsible panels for optimal map visibility, and comprehensive accessibility features. This combination of environmental awareness, intelligent routing, and user-centric design positions EcoRoute as a practical tool for sustainable travel planning.
